## What I do

- Develop clean, maintainable code with an obsession for efficiency and performance.  
- Dive deep into debugging and reverse engineering — if it’s broken, I’m your guy.  
- Optimize legacy systems and squeeze every bit of power from hardware and software.  
- Write automation scripts to kill repetitive tasks and boost productivity.  
- Maintain open-source projects focused on performance improvements and bug fixes.

## What Drives Me

> “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” — Except I also love tearing apart code and rebuilding it better.  

I’m not here to write bloated, flashy code. I’m here to build solid foundations, keep systems lean, and make sure everything runs like a well-oiled machine.
